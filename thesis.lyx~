\begin_layout Abstract
Multiprocessor real-time resource control algorithms are currently an active
 research topic as more and more real-time systems become multicore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This project intends to contribute to the field of multiprocessor resource
 sharing protocols in real-time systems.
 Multiprocessor architectures have become mainstream, used in small embedded
 devices as well as enterprise servers.
 Multiple processing units architectures offer increasing computational
 capacity performance that need to be efficiently employed.
 While we can expect massively multi-core processors chips to be available
 soon, research in the real-time systems has been mainly designed for single
 processors.
 The widespread use of multicore architectures is challenging the real-time
 systems area for a protocol that could make a consensus and presenting
 features that are at least as good as the single processor protocols.
 The purpose of a lock-based multiprocessor resource sharing protocol implementa
tion in an operating system as popular as Linux is a step forward to catch
 up on processor manufacturers.

Overview

\begin_layout Standard
This section will briefly describe the reasons for undertaking this project.
 It will introduce the technical requirements involved, as well as present
 the development workflow and finally the ethics used to complete it.

\begin_layout Subsection
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Real-Time System Group at York have recently proposed a new resource
 sharing algorithm

 based on a well known single processor resource sharing protocol.
 This report provides an implementation in a Linux Real-Time kernel.

Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Real-time systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the real-time paradigm besides of the usually expected functional correctness
 of a system, the timing e.g.
 the time needed to process an input must comply with a deadline.

 gives the following definition : 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Any information processing activity or system which has to respond to externally
 generated input stimuli within a finite and specified period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A real-time system is ordinarily composed of concurrent tasks sharing common
 resources.
 Tasks execute a sequence of operations in parallel, they have a deadline
 representing the maximum acceptable execution time.
 Tasks can be classified as periodic meaning they are triggered at regular
 intervals or aperiodic meaning they can be triggered at any time.
 A subset of aperiodic tasks are sporadic tasks, these can be triggered
 at any time with the condition that they respect a minimum time between
 each release.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concurrent programming has been studied and developed a long time before
 the apparition of multiprocessors architectures.
 It might seem odd to have concurrent execution of tasks on single processor
 systems and indeed operating systems 
\shape italic
give the impression 
\shape default
of concurrency by allocating short execution time to each task according
 to a policy implemented in the task scheduler.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We make the difference between 
\shape italic
hard, soft 
\shape default
and
\shape italic
 firm
\shape default
 real-time systems.
 Hard real-time systems put a strict constraint on respecting the deadline,
 they are usually used in industries in which response time is critical
 and where a failure to execute within the deadline equals to a system failure.
 On the other hand, soft real-time systems consider the deadline as a recommenda
tion therefore missing a deadline is not a serious error however it does
 decrease the value of the expected output.
 In firm real-time systems, missing a deadline is not a system failure although
 the output of a task is discarded by the system.
